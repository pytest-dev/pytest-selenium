Quick Start
***********

The pytest-selenium plugin provides a method scoped selenium
`fixture <http://pytest.org/latest/fixture.html>`_ for your tests. This means
that any test with selenium as an argument will cause a browser instance to be
invoked. The browser may run locally or remotely depending on your
configuration, and may even run headless.

Here's a simple example test that opens a website using Selenium:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_example(selenium):
      selenium.get('http://www.example.com')

To run the above test you will need to specify the browser instance to be
invoked. For example, to run it using Firefox installed in a default location:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Firefox

For full details of the Selenium API you can refer to the
`documentation <http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/api.html>`_.

Specifying a Base URL
*********************

Rather than repeating or abstracting the base URL in your tests, pytest-selenium
also provides a ``base_url`` fixture that by default will return a value
specified on the command line.

Here's the earlier example with the addition of ``base_url``:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_example(base_url, selenium):
      selenium.get('{0}'.format(base_url))

The associated command line would be:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --base-url http://www.example.com --driver Firefox

Dynamic Base URLs
-----------------

If your test harness takes care of launching an instance of your application
under test, you may not have a predictable base URL to provide on the command
line. Fortunately, it's easy to override the ``base_url`` fixture and return the
correct URL to your test.

In the following example a ``live_server`` fixture is used to start the
application and ``live_server.url`` returns the base URL of the site.

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.fixture
  def base_url(live_server):
      return live_server.url

  def test_search(base_url, selenium):
      selenium.get('{0}/search'.format(base_url))

Available Live Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's relatively simple to create your own ``live_server`` fixture, however you
may be able to take advantage of one of the following:

* Django applications can use
  `pytest-django <http://pytest-django.readthedocs.org/>`_, which provides a
  ``live_server`` fixture.

* Flask applications can use
  `pytest-flask <http://pytest-flask.readthedocs.org/>`_, which provides a
  ``live_server`` fixture.

Specifying a Browser
********************

To indicate the browser you want to run your tests against you will need to
specify a driver and optional capabilties.

Firefox
-------

To run your automated tests with Firefox, specify ``Firefox`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Firefox

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current implementation of the Firefox driver does not allow you to specify
the binary path, preferences, profile path, or extensions via capabilities.
There are therefore additional command line options for each of these. Check
``--help`` for further details.

Chrome
------

To use Chrome as the driver, you need to have ChromeDriver installed and
available in your PATH. You can download it
`here <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads>`_.

To run your automated tests, specify ``Chrome`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Chrome

For more information relating to ChromeDriver, you may read its documentation
`here <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/>`_.

PhantomJS
---------

To use PhantomJS as the driver, you need to have it installed and available in
your PATH. You can download it `here <http://phantomjs.org/download.html>`_.

To run your automated tests, specify ``PhantomJS`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver PhantomJS

For more information relating to PhantomJS, you may read its documentation
`here <http://phantomjs.org/quick-start.html>`_.

Selenium Server/Grid
--------------------

To run your automated tests against a
`Selenium server <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriverServer>`_
or a `Selenium Grid <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2>`_ you
must have a server running and know the host and port of the server.

By default Selenium will listen on host 127.0.0.1 and port 4444. This is also
the default when running tests against a remote driver.

To run your automated tests, simply specify ``Remote`` as your driver. Browser
selection is determined using capabilities. Check the
`documentation <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities#used-by-the-selenium-server-for-browser-selection>`_
for details of accepted values. There are also a number of
`browser specific capabilities <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities#browser-specific-capabilities>`_
that can be set. Be sure to also check the documentation for your chosen
driver, as the accepted capabilities may differ:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Remote --capability browserName firefox

Note that if your server is not running locally or is running on an alternate
port you will need to specify the ``--host`` and ``--port`` command line
options:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Remote --host selenium.hostname --port 5555 --capability browserName firefox

Sauce Labs
----------

To run your automated tests using `Sauce Labs <https://saucelabs.com/>`_, you
must provide a valid username and API key. This can be done either by using
a ``setup.cfg`` file or by setting the ``SAUCELABS_USERNAME`` and
``SAUCELABS_API_KEY`` environment variables.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example ``setup.cfg`` showing the configuration options:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pytest]
  sauce_labs_username = username
  sauce_labs_api_key = secret
  sauce_labs_job_visibility = public

The `sauce_labs_job_visibility` entry is used to determine who you share your
Sauce Labs jobs with. Check the
`documentation <https://saucelabs.com/docs/additional-config#sharing>`_ for the
accepted values. If not set, this defaults to
`public restricted <https://saucelabs.com/docs/additional-config#restricted>`_.

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run your automated tests, simply specify ``SauceLabs`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver SauceLabs --capability browserName Firefox

See the `supported platforms <https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/platforms-configurator/>`_
to help you with your configuration. Additional capabilities can be set using
the ``--capability`` command line arguments. See the
`test configuration documentation <https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/test-configuration/>`_
for full details of what can be configured.

Job visibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify the job sharing level for individual tests by setting a mark on
the test method. This takes priority over the ``sauce_labs_job_visibility``
entry in the configuration file:

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.mark.sauce_labs_job_visibility('public')
  def test_public(selenium):
      assert True

You can also explicitly mark the test as private:

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.mark.sauce_labs_job_visibility('private')
  def test_private(selenium):
      assert True

For the full list of accepted values, check the
`Sauce Labs documentation <https://saucelabs.com/docs/additional-config#sharing>`_.

BrowserStack
------------

To run your automated tests using
`BrowserStack <https://www.browserstack.com/>`_, you must provide a valid
username and access key. This can be done either by using a ``setup.cfg`` file
or by setting the ``BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME`` and ``BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY``
environment variables.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example ``setup.cfg`` showing the configuration options:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pytest]
  browserstack_username = username
  browserstack_access_key = secret

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run your automated tests, simply specify ``BrowserStack`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver BrowserStack --capability browserName Firefox

See the
`capabilities documentation <https://www.browserstack.com/automate/capabilities>`_
for additional configuration that can be set using ``--capability`` command line
arguments.

TestingBot
----------

To run your automated tests using `TestingBot <http://testingbot.com/>`_, you
must provide a valid key and secret. This can be done either by using a
``setup.cfg`` file or by setting the ``TESTINGBOT_KEY`` and
``TESTINGBOT_SECRET`` environment variables.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example ``setup.cfg`` showing the configuration options:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pytest]
  testingbot_key = key
  testingbot_secret = secret

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run your automated tests, simply specify ``TestingBot`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver TestingBot --capability browserName firefox --capability browserName 39 --capability platform WIN8

See the `list of available browsers <http://testingbot.com/support/getting-started/browsers.html>`_
to help you with your configuration. Additional capabilities can be set using
the ``--capability`` command line arguments. See the
`test options <http://testingbot.com/support/other/test-options>`_
for full details of what can be configured.

Capabilities
------------

Configuration options are specified using a capabilities dictionary. This is
required when using a Selenium server to specify the target environment, but
can also be used to configure local drivers.

To specify capabilities, you can provide a JSON file on the command line using
the `pytest-variables <https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-variables>`_ plugin.
For example if you had a ``capabilties.json`` containing your capabilities, you
would need to include ``--variables capabilities.json`` on your command line.

The following is an example of a variables file including capabilities:

.. code-block:: json

  { "capabilities": {
      "browserName": "Firefox",
      "platform": "MAC" }
  }

Simple capabilities can be set or overridden on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Remote --capability browserName Firefox

You can also add or change capabilities by overwriting the ``capabilities``
fixture:

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.fixture
  def capabilities(capabilities):
      capabilities['tags'] = ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']
      return capabilities

Common Selenium Setup
*********************

If you have common setup that you want to apply to your tests, such as setting
the implicit timeout or window size, you can override the ``selenium`` fixture:

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.fixture
  def selenium(selenium):
      selenium.implicitly_wait(10)
      selenium.maximize_window()
      return selenium
