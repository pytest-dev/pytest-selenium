Quick Start
***********

The pytest-selenium plugin provides a method scoped selenium
`fixture <http://pytest.org/latest/fixture.html>`_ for your tests. This means
that any test with selenium as an argument will cause a browser instance to be
invoked. The browser may run locally or remotely depending on your
configuration, and may even run headless.

Here's a simple example test that opens a website using Selenium:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_example(selenium):
      selenium.get('http://www.example.com')

To run the above test you will need to specify the browser instance to be
invoked. For example, to run it using Firefox installed in a default location:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Firefox

For full details of the Selenium API you can refer to the
`documentation <http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/api.html>`_.

Specifying a Base URL
*********************

Rather than repeating or abstracting the base URL in your tests, pytest-selenium
also provides a ``base_url`` fixture that returns the specified base URL.

Here's the earlier example with the addition of ``base_url``:

.. code-block:: python

  def test_example(base_url, selenium):
      selenium.get('{0}'.format(base_url))

Using the Command Line
----------------------

You can specify the base URL on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --base-url http://www.example.com --driver Firefox

Using a Configuration File
--------------------------

You can specify the base URL using a configuration file:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pytest]
  base_url = http://www.example.com

Using a Fixture
---------------

If your test harness takes care of launching an instance of your application
under test, you may not have a predictable base URL to provide on the command
line. Fortunately, it's easy to override the ``base_url`` fixture and return the
correct URL to your test.

In the following example a ``live_server`` fixture is used to start the
application and ``live_server.url`` returns the base URL of the site.

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.fixture
  def base_url(live_server):
      return live_server.url

  def test_search(base_url, selenium):
      selenium.get('{0}/search'.format(base_url))

Available Live Servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's relatively simple to create your own ``live_server`` fixture, however you
may be able to take advantage of one of the following:

* Django applications can use
  `pytest-django <http://pytest-django.readthedocs.org/>`_, which provides a
  ``live_server`` fixture.

* Flask applications can use
  `pytest-flask <http://pytest-flask.readthedocs.org/>`_, which provides a
  ``live_server`` fixture.

Verifying the Base URL
----------------------

If you specify a base URL for a site that's unavailable then all tests using
that base URL will likely fail. To avoid running every test in this instance,
you can enable base URL verification. This will check the base URL is
responding before proceeding with the test suite. To enable this, specify the
``--verify-base-url`` command line option or set the ``VERIFY_BASE_URL``
environment variable to ``TRUE``.


Sensitive Environments
**********************

To avoid accidental changes being made to sensitive environments such as
your production instances, all tests are assumed to be destructive. Any
destructive tests attempted to run against a sensitive environment will be
skipped.

Nondestructive Tests
--------------------

To explicitly mark a test as nondestructive, you can add the appropriate marker
as shown here:

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.mark.nondestructive
  def test_nondestructive(selenium):
      selenium.get('http://www.example.com')

Indicating Sensitive Environments
---------------------------------

Sensitive environments are indicated by a regular expression applied to the
base URL or any URLs discovered in the history of redirects when retrieving
the base URL. By default this matches all URLs, but can be configured on by
setting the ``SENSITIVE_URL`` environment variable, or by using the command
line:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --sensitive-url "example\.com"

To disable skipping for senstive URLs, this can be set to ``None``.

Specifying a Browser
********************

To indicate the browser you want to run your tests against you will need to
specify a driver and optional capabilties.

Firefox
-------

To run your automated tests with Firefox, specify ``Firefox`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Firefox

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The current implementation of the Firefox driver does not allow you to specify
the binary path, preferences, profile path, or extensions via capabilities.
There are therefore additional command line options for each of these. Check
``--help`` for further details.

Chrome
------

To use Chrome, you will need to
`download ChromeDriver <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads>`_.
and specify ``Chrome`` for the ``--driver`` command line option. If the driver
executable is not available on your path, you can use the ``--driver-path``
option to indicate where it can be found:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Chrome --driver-path /path/to/chromedriver

See the `ChromeDriver documentation <https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/>`_
for more information.

Internet Explorer
-----------------

To use Internet Explorer, you will need to download and configure the
`Internet Explorer Driver <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/InternetExplorerDriver>`_
and specify ``IE`` for the ``--driver`` command line option. If the driver
executable is not available on your path, you can use the ``--driver-path``
option to indicate where it can be found:

.. code-block:: batch

  > py.test --driver IE --driver-path \path\to\IEDriverServer.exe

PhantomJS
---------

To use PhantomJS, you will need `download it <http://phantomjs.org/download.html>`_.
and specify ``PhantomJS`` for the ``--driver`` command line option. If
the driver executable is not available on your path, you can use the
``--driver-path`` option to indicate where it can be found:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver PhantomJS --driver-path /path/to/phantomjs

See the `PhantomJS documentation <http://phantomjs.org/quick-start.html>`_ for
more information.

Selenium Server/Grid
--------------------

To run your automated tests against a
`Selenium server <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/RemoteWebDriverServer>`_
or a `Selenium Grid <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2>`_ you
must have a server running and know the host and port of the server.

By default Selenium will listen on host 127.0.0.1 and port 4444. This is also
the default when running tests against a remote driver.

To run your automated tests, simply specify ``Remote`` as your driver. Browser
selection is determined using capabilities. Check the
`documentation <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities#used-by-the-selenium-server-for-browser-selection>`_
for details of accepted values. There are also a number of
`browser specific capabilities <https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities#browser-specific-capabilities>`_
that can be set. Be sure to also check the documentation for your chosen
driver, as the accepted capabilities may differ:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Remote --capability browserName firefox

Note that if your server is not running locally or is running on an alternate
port you will need to specify the ``--host`` and ``--port`` command line
options:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Remote --host selenium.hostname --port 5555 --capability browserName firefox

Sauce Labs
----------

To run your automated tests using `Sauce Labs <https://saucelabs.com/>`_, you
must provide a valid username and API key. This can be done either by using
a ``setup.cfg`` file or by setting the ``SAUCELABS_USERNAME`` and
``SAUCELABS_API_KEY`` environment variables.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example ``setup.cfg`` showing the configuration options:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pytest]
  sauce_labs_username = username
  sauce_labs_api_key = secret

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run your automated tests, simply specify ``SauceLabs`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver SauceLabs --capability browserName Firefox

See the `supported platforms <https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/platforms-configurator/>`_
to help you with your configuration. Additional capabilities can be set using
the ``--capability`` command line arguments. See the
`test configuration documentation <https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/test-configuration/>`_
for full details of what can be configured.

BrowserStack
------------

To run your automated tests using
`BrowserStack <https://www.browserstack.com/>`_, you must provide a valid
username and access key. This can be done either by using a ``setup.cfg`` file
or by setting the ``BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME`` and ``BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY``
environment variables.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example ``setup.cfg`` showing the configuration options:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pytest]
  browserstack_username = username
  browserstack_access_key = secret

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run your automated tests, simply specify ``BrowserStack`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver BrowserStack --capability browserName Firefox

See the
`capabilities documentation <https://www.browserstack.com/automate/capabilities>`_
for additional configuration that can be set using ``--capability`` command line
arguments.

TestingBot
----------

To run your automated tests using `TestingBot <http://testingbot.com/>`_, you
must provide a valid key and secret. This can be done either by using a
``setup.cfg`` file or by setting the ``TESTINGBOT_KEY`` and
``TESTINGBOT_SECRET`` environment variables.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is an example ``setup.cfg`` showing the configuration options:

.. code-block:: ini

  [pytest]
  testingbot_key = key
  testingbot_secret = secret

Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run your automated tests, simply specify ``TestingBot`` as your driver:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver TestingBot --capability browserName firefox --capability browserName 39 --capability platform WIN8

See the `list of available browsers <http://testingbot.com/support/getting-started/browsers.html>`_
to help you with your configuration. Additional capabilities can be set using
the ``--capability`` command line arguments. See the
`test options <http://testingbot.com/support/other/test-options>`_
for full details of what can be configured.

Specifying Capabilities
***********************

Configuration options are specified using a capabilities dictionary. This is
required when using a Selenium server to specify the target environment, but
can also be used to configure local drivers.

Command Line Capabilities
-------------------------

Simple capabilities can be set or overridden on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ py.test --driver Remote --capability browserName Firefox

Capabilities Files
------------------

To specify capabilities, you can provide a JSON file on the command line using
the `pytest-variables <https://github.com/davehunt/pytest-variables>`_ plugin.
For example if you had a ``capabilties.json`` containing your capabilities, you
would need to include ``--variables capabilities.json`` on your command line.

The following is an example of a variables file including capabilities:

.. code-block:: json

  { "capabilities": {
      "browserName": "Firefox",
      "platform": "MAC" }
  }

Capabilities Fixture
--------------------

You can add or change capabilities by overwriting the ``capabilities`` fixture:

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.fixture(scope='session')
  def capabilities(capabilities):
      capabilities['tags'] = ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']
      return capabilities

Capabilities Marker
-------------------

You can add or change capabilities using the ``capabilities`` marker:

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.mark.capabilities(foo='bar')
  def test_capabilities(selenium):
      selenium.get('http://www.example.com')

Common Selenium Setup
*********************

If you have common setup that you want to apply to your tests, such as setting
the implicit timeout or window size, you can override the ``selenium`` fixture:

.. code-block:: python

  import pytest
  @pytest.fixture
  def selenium(selenium):
      selenium.implicitly_wait(10)
      selenium.maximize_window()
      return selenium
