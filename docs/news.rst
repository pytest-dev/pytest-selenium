Release Notes
=============

**1.10.0 (unreleased)**

* Add alternate credentials environment variables for Jenkins declarative
  pipelines.

  * Thanks to `@BeyondEvil <https://github.com/BeyondEvil>`_ for the PR

* Deprecate :code:`--firefox-extension`, :code:`--firefox-path`,
  :code:`--firefox-preference`, and :code:`--firefox-profile` command line
  options. The preferred way to set these is now through the
  :code:`firefox_options` fixture.

* Only create a Firefox profile if :code:`--firefox-extension`,
  :code:`--firefox-preference`, or :code:`--firefox-profile` is specified.

* Add :code:`chrome_options` fixture for configuring Google Chrome.

**1.9.1 (2017-03-01)**

* Add capabilities to metadata during :code:`pytest_configure` hook instead of
  the :code:`session_capabilities` fixture to make them available to other
  plugins earlier.

**1.9.0 (2017-02-27)**

* Add driver and session capabilities to metadata provided by
  `pytest-metadata <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-metadata/>`_

**1.8.0 (2017-01-25)**

* **BREAKING CHANGE:** Moved cloud testing provider credentials into separate
  files for improved security.

  * If you are using the environment variables for specifying cloud testing
    provider credentials, then you will not be affected.
  * If you are storing credentials from any of the cloud testing providers in
    one of the default configuration files then they will no longer be used.
    These files are often checked into source code repositories, so it was
    previously very easy to accidentally expose your credentials.
  * Each cloud provider now has their own configuration file, such as
    ``.browserstack``, ``.crossbrowsertesting``, ``.saucelabs``,
    ``.testingbot`` and these can be located in the working directory or in the
    user's home directory. This provides a convenient way to set up these files
    globally, and override them for individual projects.
  * To migrate, check ``pytest.ini``, ``tox.ini``, and ``setup.cfg`` for any
    keys starting with ``browserstack_``, ``crossbrowsertesting_``,
    ``saucelabs_``, or ``testingbot_``. If you find any, create a new
    configuration file for the appropriate cloud testing provider with your
    credentials, and remove the entries from the original file.
  * The configuration keys can differ between cloud testing providers, so
    please check the :doc:`user_guide` for details.
  * See `#60 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium/issues/60>`_ for
    for original issue and related patch.
