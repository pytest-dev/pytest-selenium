Development
===========

Automated Testing
-----------------

All pull requests and merges are tested in `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/>`_
based on the ``.travis.yml`` file.

Usually, a link to your specific travis build appears in pull requests, but if
not, you can find it on the
`pull requests page <https://travis-ci.org/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium/pull_requests>`_

The only way to trigger Travis CI to run again for a pull request, is to submit
another change to the pull branch.

Running Tests
-------------

You will need `Tox <http://tox.testrun.org/>`_ installed to run the tests
against the supported Python versions.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install tox
  $ tox

Drivers
-------
To run the tests you're going to need some browser drivers.

Releasing a new version
-----------------------

Follow these steps to release a new version of the project:

1. Update your local master with the upstream master (``git pull --rebase upstream master``)
2. Create a new branch and update ``news.rst`` with the new version, today's date, and all changes/new features
3. Commit and push the new branch and then create a new pull request
4. Wait for tests and reviews and then merge the branch
5. Once merged, update your local master again (``git pull --rebase upstream master``)
6. Tag the release with the new release version (``git tag v<new tag>``)
7. Push the tag (``git push upstream --tags``)
8. Done. You can monitor the progress on `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium/>`_
